usage: /home/dyn/go/bin//gomobile build [-target android|ios] [-o output] [-bundleid bundleID] [build flags] [package]

Build compiles and encodes the app named by the import path.

The named package must define a main function.

The -target flag takes a target system name, either android (the
default) or ios.

For -target android, if an AndroidManifest.xml is defined in the
package directory, it is added to the APK output. Otherwise, a default
manifest is generated. By default, this builds a fat APK for all supported
instruction sets (arm, 386, amd64, arm64). A subset of instruction sets can
be selected by specifying target type with the architecture name. E.g.
-target=android/arm,android/386.

For -target ios, gomobile must be run on an OS X machine with Xcode
installed.

If the package directory contains an assets subdirectory, its contents
are copied into the output.

Flag -iosversion sets the minimal version of the iOS SDK to compile against.
The default version is 6.1.

The -bundleid flag is for -target ios only and sets the bundle ID to use
with the app; defaults to "org.golang.todo".

The -o flag specifies the output file name. If not specified, the
output file name depends on the package built.

The -v flag provides verbose output, including the list of packages built.

The build flags -a, -i, -n, -x, -gcflags, -ldflags, -tags, and -work are
shared with the build command. For documentation, see 'go help build'.
